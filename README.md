# POST a Gift

You'll be working with the [holiday shopping API](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/holiday-shopping-api) from Day Three. This time, you'll focus on writing some POST requests!

You'll be finishing up the functionality of this gift adding application. The HTML and CSS have been written for you, so that you can focus on the functionality, but you are welcome to change things if needed. 

A few things to consider:
* As a user, when I fill out the form to add a new gift, I should see a message indicating that it was successful.
* As a user, I am not able to submit the form unless I have provided a recipient, name of gift and price.
* As a user, I can submit the form without providing an optional link.
