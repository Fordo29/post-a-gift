You'll be working with the [holiday shopping API](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/holiday-shopping-api) from Day Three. This time, you'll focus on writing some POST requests!

You'll be writing the functionality of this gift list adding application. The HTML and CSS have been written for you, so that you can focus on the functionality, but you will need to add a . 

**User stories for the functionality to build**
* As a user, when I fill out the form to add a new gift, I should see a message indicating that it was successful. 
* As a user, I am not able to submit the form unless I have provided a recipient, name of gift and price. 
* As a user, I can submit the form without providing an optional link. 

_Make sure to consider the user experience! For every step, think about what information the user would want to see!_

**BONUS**
* You don't _need_ to have a class to achieve the above functionality, but try adding one anyway. Make sure you're writing tests for it to. What benefit does this give you to use a class vs. storing everything in `script.js`?
* Submitting the gift form could be a bit more exciting. Try implementing this [canvas-confetti npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas-confetti) to set off some confetti when the submit button is clicked.
